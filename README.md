AlphaCryo4D v0.1.0-lite Development Version

This is a simplified version of AlphaCryo4D. Relion 3.1.3 or newer is required. Old-style STAR files from relion 3.0 or earlier should be converted manually by relion_convert_star before using this version of AlphaCryo4D.

Scripts running order:  
1. (optional) relion_star_handler --split (and name the output files as batch1.star, batch2.star, ...)
2. bootstrap.py (n<=52 is the total number of subsets; g is the number of subsets in each group and better be odd.)
3. relion_refine --skip_align (so as to create multiple 3D classes)
4. (optional) Do reconstruction and apply a specific mask for each 3D class (not necessary if only use the landscape for classification). 
5. link.sh
6. run_prepare.py
7. run_resnet.py (Before running, change values of -e and -v based on the size of your 3D class dataset.)
8. run_predict.py
9. tsne_prepare.py
10. tsne_rd.py (to get a basic conformational distribution plotted as tsne.png)
11. enumerate.sh
12. landscape.py (Before running, change --range according to tsne.png.)
13. Create a text file with maps' index filled in each line, which are selected inside a specified area of the landscape.
14. vote_prepare.sh "the text file"
15. vote.sh (th is the voting threshold, which is (g+1)/2 as recommended. Finally you can get the post_vote.star for further analysis.)

==================================================

AlphaCryo4D is an open-source free software released under GNU General Public LICENSE that implements 3D classification of single-particle cryo-EM data using deep manifold learning and novel energy-based particle voting methods (originally proposed in the following bioRxiv preprint by the Mao laboratory). AlphaCryo4D v0.1.0c is currently a development version, NOT a stable released version. The authors are currently optimizing the code architecture and adding novel features to the system. The future version of this open-source software will be updated with a user-friendly interface. Users are free to use and modify the source code, providing their compliance with the GPL and that any publication making use of this software shall cite the following reference or its formally published form:
